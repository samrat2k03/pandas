**Pandas**

âš¡**there are 2 data structures in pandas** 
      

1.   **Series**
2.   **DataFrames**  âš¡

Series
--> one dimensional array holding data of any type
"""

mySeriesData = {'author': 'samrat', 'nickname': 'sanjay', 'fav fiction character': 'bruce'}

print(age.describe())

"""The describe() method provides a quick overview of the numerical data in a DataFrame.

ðŸ’ªâš¡ A Series, by contrast, is a sequence of data values. If a DataFrame is a table, a Series is a list. And in fact you can create one with nothing more than a list:*italicized text* âš¡

Dataframe --> multi dimensional array

### To select the column, use the column label in between square brackets [].
